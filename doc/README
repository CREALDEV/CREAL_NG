CREAL was a project created at the Center for Research and Education on Aging
in order to assist biologists conduct advanced and powerful mathematical
simulations.

When the project was first initiated, it was merely a small php web application.
The previoius scientist left the project abruptly, and then Randall White was 
tasked to increasing performance by utilizing graphical processing units. 

Information about gpus increasing parallel performance was taken per diem, 
instead of heavy investigations. Gpus are very tuned to certain workloads, this it was not suitable for our simulations. 

What came out of the project was dynamic compilation from the standpoint of the C programming language.

CREAL evolved into a self modifyable framework for biologists to create 
high performance straight to metal simulations.
